                A mobile version of a software called mySPECTRA-portal needed to be implemented. 
                Numerous tables of data in the mentioned software required a decision to be either omitted or consolidated. 
                Therefore, prioritizing important information due to the size of mobile screen compared to web applications should've be considered and only significant information stayed. 
                The key data such as columns that users need to access quickly have been identified. Moreover, it was crucial to remove less critical columns instead mention them under expandable sections.

            <ul>
                <li>Developing the design of a mobile application for a software platforms used by LStelcom</li>
                <li>Comarision and prioritization of data used on the web application to be in the mobile version</li>
                <li>Understanding of the overall concept of license registeration</li>
                
            </ul>


            <h2>Possible solutions</h2>
            <li>Provide list of all of available products</li>
            <li>Categorize products that are availabe to be used on mobile screen</li>
            <li>Make potential personas</li>
            <li>Ideate solutions such as card sorting</li>
            <li>Optimize user flow</li>
            <li>Create high fidelity prototypes</li>

                    <li>Checks the data/ requests</li>
                    <li>Confirm the data</li>
                    <li>Give approvals based on the demands</li>
                </ul>
            
                <br>

                <p>After gathering all the general information about our users, the process of making personas visually started. The results of mySPECTA-Portal are shown below. 
                    I have added personal info such as age, career, education, and location. Also added tasks, skills, frustration, and motivations of the user while working with the application. 
                    Plus, the bio and a bold sentence given by each user. All this information helped me to have a better understanding of my users and to give a solution that is useable for all of them. 
                    Of course, it is not always possible to fulfill every wish of all users at once. But having the personas is a good resource for making most of the demands available to bring the highest satisfaction for the costumers.</p>

                     <p>After learning the process of data registration in the web application now it's time to
                        make a flow of the same process in the mobile application based on our user needs. 
                        I have made a flow chart by exploring software platforms at LS telcom and extracting the mutual actions leading to an activity for the user to achieve their goals in the mobile application. 
                        This flow chart describes the starting points, actions required, moments of decision, and endpoints.

                        <h2>Wireframing and Prototype Ideation</h2>
                     <p>started to develop ideas for the defined problems in the software platforms of the company and delivered the idea to the mobile version. 
                        For example, using cards instead of huge tables of data. Of course, it is normal to have tables of data on big screens such as monitors at the office but the same doesn‚Äôt go with small mobile screens. 
                        Therefore, I think of having all the important required information such as application number, service name, and amount to pay in a minimal card for the mobile screen. 
                        I started bringing the ideas on paper as you can see in the image below one of the wireframing‚Äôs based on the initial ideas for the login dialog.
                        </p>
                     <div class="image-container"> 
                         <img src="./img/prototype.PNG" alt="proto" class="responsive-image">
                     </div>

                    <div>
                     <h2>Design and Iteration</h2>
                        <p>After ideation and wireframing, I built a suitable useful design, starting from the login dialog using the Figma tool.
                        The iterative design process is a simple concept. Once, through user research, you have identified a user need and have generated ideas to meet that need, you develop a prototype.
                        Then you test the prototype to see whether it meets the need in the best possible way. 
                        Then you take what you learned from testing and amend the design. Following that, you create a new prototype and begin the process all over again until you are satisfied that you‚Äôve reached the best possible product for release to the market.
                        Iteration can be used at any phase of the design process.
                        </p>
                     <div class="image-container"> 
                        <img src="./img/iteration.png" alt="iterate" class="responsive-image">
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                           <p>Although details always need to be considered but knowing about the concept is of great significance. 
                            Horizontal scroll for tables is quite difficult to get right. Users tend to get lost in a large table, often not knowing what represents what and what exactly are looking at. 
                            Feature Comparison tables can be helpful in this case. Moreover, grouping with tabs or accordions can be very usable. We could allow users to navigate through the different features of different plans with accordance or sticky tabs.
                             This is useful to allow users to quickly jump between the plans and find a good fit for them.
